Exercise 1: Print the length of the Cholerae ori (ori is a sequence given in a file named ori; this file is provided with the assignment). 

Exercise 2: Print  the number of times that the string Pattern = "TGATCA" occurs in the string Text corresponding to the cholerae ori, which is found in ori file.

Exercise 3:The Frequent Words Problem
We say that Pattern is a most frequent k-mer in Text if it maximizes PatternCount(Pattern, Text) among all k-mers. You can verify that "ACTAT" is a most frequent 5-mer for Text = "ACAACTATGCATACTATCGGGAACTATCCT", and "ATA" is a most frequent 3-mer for Text = "CGATATATCCATAG".

	3.1: Find the most frequent 2-mer of "GATCCAGATCCCCATAC". 
	3.2: Find the most frequent k-mers in a string.
     		Input: A string Text and an integer k.
     		Output: All most frequent k-mers in Text.
